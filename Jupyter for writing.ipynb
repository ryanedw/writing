It also studies how they feel about art—why they like some works and not others, and how art can affect their moods, beliefs, and attitude toward life.[3] More broadly, scholars in the field define aesthetics as \"critical reflection on art, culture and nature\".[4][5] In modern English, the term aesthetic can also refer to a set of principles underlying the works of a particular art movement or theory: one speaks, for example, of the Cubist aesthetic.[6]"
